# C++ Writting and Reading from file example
This is one component of my experiment. There's two components to this experiment as listed below:
  - C++ Component
  - Golang Component

# Description
### Small intro
This is a dummy app to demonstrate among other things how you can carry out basic I/O in C++. Why did I do this when the internet is full of such examples ? I have written this to compare C++ and Golang performance in I/O operations. Yes, there's always a better way to do it and I'd love to hear about it.

### What does the app do ? 
This is a super basic dummy payroll system. Pays employees and keeps records of who got paid when. It does this in the following steps:
  - Read a list of employees from file and into a vector list
  - Pays these employees
  - Saves a list of processed employees to a separate file

### Metrics
I will try and use Prometheus for metrics here if I can. Be on the lookout.
